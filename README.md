## Infos for developers

The core of TagSpaces starting from version 3 is build with [react.js](https://reactjs.org/) and the great [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) framework.

The native Windows, Linux and Mac OS versions of TagSpaces are built with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/). Electron is an app runtime based on Chromium and node.js. In order to combine it with react we have used the [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

### How to run TagSpaces from the source code?
In order to run TagSpaces on your Windows, Mac OS or Linux from the source code published here, you will need the following prerequisites:
 * [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
 * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), currently we prefer yarn
 * [git](http://git-scm.org/)

Get the TagSpaces source code by cloning its repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/tagspaces/tagspaces.git

Go to the folder where the code was cloned and select the branch you want to test. Use the the **master** branch for the last officially released version or the branch **develop** for a kind of a nightly build, containing the changed we are preparing for the next release of the application.

    $ cd tagspaces

	and install the project dependencies
    $ yarn install

The last command will automatically build the application with webpack. Now it is time to install all the TagSpaces extensions:

	$ yarn setup-ext

Now you are ready and can start the application with:

	$ yarn start

If you want to try the development mode, you can start it by:

	$ yarn dev

This will start a development server in background, which watches for changes in background and refreshes the application automatically once you have done some changes in the source code.

### How to create the packages for Windows, Linux and Mac OS?

Building of the packages can be accomplished with the integrated yarn scripts:

	$ yarn package-win

	$ yarn package-linux

	$ yarn package-osx

For creating the packages for Windows, Linux and Mac OS respectively.

### Developing extensions for TagSpaces
TagSpaces can be easily extended with the help of extensions. Currently we use the extensions for supporting the opening and editing of different file types in the application.

### How to start the WebDAV edition for testing?
The webdav version of the app can be started with the following yarn command:

    $ yarn run-web

This command will start a local node.js-WebDAV server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Open your browser and enter the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html

You will be prompted for user credentials, which are username: `demo` and password: `demo` and now you should be able to work with the WebDAV version of TagSpaces.

For setting up the WebDAV version on your server, please read [Self-hosted TagSpaces with WebDAV](https://docs.tagspaces.org/selfhosting.html) from our blogs.

## Contribute
TagSpaces is an open source software and as such, the code is publicly available on GitHub, and forking is particularly recommended! Still, contribution must be done following some guidelines.
Contributor License Agreement

The CLA is an agreement commonly used in major open source project, which aims at protecting all parties implied by a contribution: the contributor, the main code author, and above all, the community. The CLA model we have chosen basically tells the following: the contributionâ€™s copyright is shared between the contributor and the main author. This means each party can do whatever she want in term of relicensing with this contributed piece of code. This is important, because, if in the future, the author wants to change the license in something more in favor of the community, a singular contributor cannot block the process.
